# **Contributor Code of Conduct**

BUST (BadUSB Safety Tester) is a defensive, non‑destructive project built for system owners, blue‑team practitioners, and researchers who want to understand and reduce their exposure to keystroke‑injection attacks.  
To keep the project safe, welcoming, and focused, all contributors are expected to follow this Code of Conduct.
